In the Tenants module of the system, users can efficiently manage tenant details and link
them to the correct apartment block and house number. Once a tenant is added, the system
generates a pre-filled Tenancy Lease Agreement, which is available as a downloadable PDF.
Users can also upload signed agreements into the system, which can be viewed later by
clicking the 'View Agreement' button.
Additionally, the module includes a feature to vacate tenants. When a tenant is vacated,
users can log repair items, input repair costs, and note the deposit amount paid back, along
with the reference number for the refund. All these actions are documented and compiled in
the Vacated Tenants Report for future reference.

## Workflow

## Payments Module
In the Payments module, users can efficiently handle tenant payments such as deposits, rent,
and service charges. The system calculates the tenant's balance based on the house rent and
allows users to reconcile payments with bank or MPESA statements. When reconciling, the
system records the 'Statement Amount', calculates the Actual Balance, and includes any
arrears from previous months. It also generates a detailed receipt containing tenant
information, apartment name, house number, rent amount, service charges, and monthly
arrears, with the receipt available for download in PDF format.
Before processing rental payments, users can also generate and send an invoice to tenants in
PDF form, making it easier to manage payment collection.
